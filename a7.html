</h1>

<ul id="pDiv">
    <li id="firstChild">list1</li>
    <li id="SecondChild">list2</li>
    <li id="thirdChild">list3</li>
    
   </ul>

   <h3>check in console</h3>

<script>
 console.log(pDiv.childNodes);

// As we know window object every thing we write in our code is considered as a node even a "space" there for if we console childNodes it will give us every node such as "space" or a "comment".

console.log(pDiv.children);
// But if we use children it will gives us only HTML elements ignoring "space" "cpmments" etc.
